# Optimizing-Delivery-Routes-for-a-Logistics-Network
This project focuses on optimizing delivery routes for a logistics network, improving efficiency in transportation by minimizing travel distance and time. The solution is based on the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), which aims to find the best routes for multiple vehicles to deliver goods to various locations while considering constraints like vehicle capacity, delivery times, and distances. The project uses Google's OR-Tools to solve the VRP with realistic data inputs.

Input Data:

Distance Matrix: Represents the distances between locations (in kilometers).
Vehicle Capacities: The weight capacity for each vehicle.
Parcel Sizes: The weight of parcels to be delivered.
Delivery Times: The time taken to deliver to each location.
Output:

Optimized routes for each vehicle.
Total distance and time for all the routes.

Features
Route Optimization: Minimizes the total distance and time taken by vehicles.
Multiple Vehicles: Supports multiple vehicles with varying capacities.
Realistic Constraints: Handles parcel sizes, delivery times, and vehicle capacities.
Output Details: Displays optimized routes, distances, and time taken for each route.
Technologies
Python 3.x
Google OR-Tools: For solving the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP).
Pandas: For handling data manipulation (if applicable).
NumPy: For numerical operations (if applicable).
Jupyter Notebook (if applicable): For running analysis in an interactive environment.
