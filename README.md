# Optimizing-Delivery-Routes-for-a-Logistics-Network
This project aims to optimize delivery routes for a logistics network using the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) approach with Google OR-Tools. The solver efficiently plans delivery routes for multiple vehicles, taking into account realistic constraints such as vehicle capacities, delivery times, parcel sizes, and distances.
